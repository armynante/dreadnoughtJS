# dreadnoughtJS
A single player battleship clone.

I was reading an intersting article about writing a battlship AI for a stackoverflow competition [on the Datagenetics blog](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html). Seemed like an interesting challenge to build in Javascript. Wanted to build it with as few libraries as possible.

##To Install
make sure you have node installed and
run    `npm install`

##Todo
- [ ] Improve AI so it kills off ships before hunting for a new target.
- [ ] Make the game statistics log to a csv file
- [X] Autobuild for boards
